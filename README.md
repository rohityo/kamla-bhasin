# Chanakya

## How to run the Project?

0. Ensure you are using Node version v10.16.0
1. `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Set up the DB in POSTGRESQL. Read the `How to use Knex Migrations?` section.
3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and update the required variables. You can use `sample.env` as the skeleton.
4. `npm start` to run the server. The server will run with auto reloading using nodemon.

## Good Practices

### Linting

Code should be properly linted before any pull request is merged into the master. npm run lint to see all the linting errors. In cases where exceptions need to be made and a particular linting error cannot be fixed use the following code above the concerned line.

```javascript
// eslint-disable-next-line no-useless-escape
```

Here `no-useless-escape` is the rule which needs to be ignored for the line below.

### Constants

Don't hard code any values in the code whatsoever. Try to always declare the values in `lib/constants.js` instead of declaring them anywhere in the code. Here's an example on how we declared the current mode in constants and then used it across the code.

```javascript
{
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  supportedModes: {
    prod: 'production',
    dev: 'development',
  },
}
```

The above snippet is from `lib/constants.js`. Now to write a conditional logic on basis of the mode which the server is running under right now, we wrote the following code in `lib/services/exotel.js`

```javascript
if (CONSTANTS.mode !== CONSTANTS.supportedModes.prod) {
  // do something here
}
```

The mode is not picked from the `process.env` neither is the value to which it is compared.

### Services

All the heavy business logic should exist strictly in the concerned services. No logic should be there in any helper file or the API endpoints

## How to use Knex Migrations?

The initial schema created while developing Chanakya is not created as a Knex migration but stored in a SQL file in `sqlScripts/initialSchema.sql`. When you are installing Chanakya for the first time you need to first import this schema into the POTGTRESQL DB.

After importing the schema you can run the migrations using `npm run knex migrate:latest`.

*Note: Check `Import Schema` section under `Important Commands` to see how to import the initialSchema.sql file into your DB.*

## Important Commands

### Export Schema of DB
`mysqldump -u root -p --no-data chanakya > schema.sql`

### Import Schema
`mysql -u <insert your username> -p chanakya < sqlScripts/initialSchema.sql`

### Run server with Auto Reload
`npm start`
